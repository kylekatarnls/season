# Season

`DateTime` modifiers such as `startOfSeason`, `isInSummer`

- `Season` can be used as a service which can work with any `DateTime` or `DateTimeImmutable` object or date strings
  (which includes any subclass such as `Carbon` or `Chronos`).
- Or it can be used as a mixin to call the methods directly on `Carbon` objects.
- Mixin get automatically enabled on Laravel if auto-discovery is on.

# How to use

## The simple way
```php
(new \Season\Season)->isInSummer('2022-06-25')
(new \Season\Season)->isInSummer(new DateTimeImmutable('2022-06-25'))
(new \Season\Season)->isInSummer(Carbon::now())
```

Methods are available from the class `\Season\Season` which is cheap to create,
so you can just call methods from a new class everytime.

As a good practice, it's recommended you import the class with `use Season\Season;`
at the beginning of the file:
```php
use Season\Season;

(new Season)->isInSummer('2022-06-25');
(new Season)->isInSummer(new DateTimeImmutable('2022-06-25'));
```

And also to keep the same instance to re-use multiple times:
```php
use Season\Season;

$season = new Season();
$season->isInSummer('2022-06-25');
$season->isInSummer(new DateTimeImmutable('2022-06-25'));
```

## As a service

You can use dependency injection with your framework:
```php
use Season\Season;
use Psr\Clock\ClockInterface;

class ProductController
{
    public function new(Season $season, ClockInterface $clock)
    {
        $seasonName = $season->getSeason($clock->now())->getName();
    }
}
```

With Laravel it will be provided by default, With Symfony, you'll
have to register `\Season\Season` as a service, see
[Configuring Services in the Container](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html#creating-configuring-services-in-the-container)


```php
use Season\Season;

$season = new Season();
$season->isInSummer('2022-06-25');
$season->isInSummer(new DateTimeImmutable('2022-06-25'));
```

## As Carbon methods (mixin)

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Cmixin\SeasonMixin;

// On Laravel, the mixin will be loaded by default.
// On other applications/framework, you can enable it with:
Carbon::mixin(SeasonMixin::class);

Carbon::parse('2022-06-25')->isInSummer();
```
You can use mixin on `CarbonImmutable`, `Carbon` or any of
their subclasses.

# Laravel

## Disable

If you use Laravel but don't want to enable `Season` mixin
globally for `Carbon`, you can remove it from auto-discovery using:

```json
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        "dont-discover": [
            "cmixin/season"
        ]
    }
},
```

## Configuration

By default, `Season` is created with the following config:
```php
[
    3 => 20, // spring
    6 => 21, // summer
    9 => 22, // fall
    12 => 21, // winter
]
```
mapping the month (as key) with the day (as value) for each season
start.

But you can pass a custom config with other days as long as the keys
remain.

If you use it as a service with Symfony, you can pass it as an
argument:
[Injecting Services/Config into a Service](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html#manually-wiring-arguments)

If you use the Carbon mixin with Laravel, you can set the config
in **config/season.php**:

```php
<?php return [
    3 => 21, // spring
    6 => 21, // summer
    9 => 21, // fall
    12 => 21, // winter
];
```
